I see pair2_Assignment1 directory. Am I going to see
pair1_Assignment1 directory. This is a pair effort. Has your
pair disappeared? I want to see good directory structure.

src for source
test for test

Please create a good directory name and structure.

CartTest:
Start with fundamental Cart behavior. Putting letter on it,
collecting it. Spell checking really is not the business of
cart, so it should not belong in this test.

Then drive negative tests on these.

Remove comments that are useful from the code.
Remove IDE vomits.
